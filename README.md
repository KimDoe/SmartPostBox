SmartPostBox.c is the code for a particle argon board. You can find the IDE on the Internet. This board is connected to the hardware.

IOT-SmartPostbox App.zip - there you will find the code for the AndroidApp.

The hardware consist of three parts. Part one the LEDs on the bottom of the Post Box. The Sensors (photodiodes) on the Top of the Post Box. 
You also need a reedswitch for the flap of the Post Box and probably a magnet on the flap to produce a signal with the reedswitch.
